I've been wanting to play around with [nixos](https://nixos.org) for a while, so here it is.

The goal here is to have a completely reproducible shell environment, ideally separated from the host OS, assuming it can have some sort of nixos layer installed on it. I would also like to have a completely reproducible host os, so it would be cool if it's somehow modular that I can kinda use like a cloud-init file or something and it brings up an entire environment for me with all of my dotfiles and configuration etc.
