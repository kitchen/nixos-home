I've been wanting to play around with [nixos](https://nixos.org) for a while, so here it is.

The goal here is to have a completely reproducible shell environment, ideally separated from the host OS, assuming it can have some sort of nixos layer installed on it. I would also like to have a completely reproducible host os, so it would be cool if it's somehow modular that I can kinda use like a cloud-init file or something and it brings up an entire environment for me with all of my dotfiles and configuration etc.

# warning

please note that I have very little idea what I'm actually doing, so please for the moment don't take anything in this repo as a "right way" to do anything. Getting this installed and running on a fresh machine is still quite a process and I also haven't finished porting over all of my dotfiles, so this is still very "it kinda works" state.

PRs always welcome, of course ;-)
