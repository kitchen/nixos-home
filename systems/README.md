these are still all copied around manually and such and I attempt to keep them in sync.

I'll eventually figure out how to something something with these but for now they're mostly just a backup and I try to edit here first and copy things over rather than do it live and copy back

# current status

as of writing, the way I'm using these is I am copying all of the `*.nix` files from this directory and `<machine>/configuration.nix` into `/etc/nixos/` and using `nixos-rebuild switch` to apply them. Seems to work fine.
